## Concurrent session claim
# Coordination board

| Task | Status | Owner | File scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Official-source research, privacy-safe site, integration and publication | in progress | arena-a07a8788 | COORDINATION.md, README.md, site files, GitHub Pages configuration |

The Arena session branch is fixed at `arena/a07a8788-rentincreasesf3`; this session cannot create or switch to a `session-*` branch. No prior claims were present when this board was created.

- Concurrent sessions claimed work before either board was visible. Main received PR #2; this rebase preserves both boards. Integration conflict requires review.
